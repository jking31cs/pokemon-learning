# pokemon-learning
Learning reinforcement learning techniques using pokemon battle rules.


##Building and Running
Use `./gradlew build` to build the app.
Currently, I'm running this in IntelliJ to get results, but I'll add in support for running from commandline later.
Right now, it doesn't include library jars in the class path, but that's easy to fix in gradle.

##Goals
Our goal is to analysis Pokemon stats and movesets to form the ultimate team, then have it learn how to win using reinforcement learning.
